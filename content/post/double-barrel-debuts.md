The new @doublebarrelofficial kit set to drop soon. We've been seeing a lot of hype on this device. Looks like a 2 component (battery & cart) system that will come with a two finger ring attachment. We've yet to see technical specs, but we’ll keep your posted with more details. Carts appear to have a unique proprietary design (looks to be magnetically locking instead of a standard 510 thread). They're dropping a collab with @sherbinski415 as well as @710kingpen. If your attending harvest cup be sure to give these a try & give us your thoughts.

## Featured on High Times Magazine

> Double Barrel has combined all the uber-hip elements in its brass-knuckles style dual vape. The gunmetal double cartridge housing slides smoothly onto a comfortably weighted two-finger ring. No charging or buttons involved—just pull on the mouthpiece for smooth delivery of pure hits, while looking like you seriously know what’s up. Double Barrel officially launches this fall."

## Initial thoughts

It's a rather creative approach to improving upon the We’re not exactly sure what "No charging ..." meant but we hope to get you guys a full in-depth review as soon as we get our hands on it. On another note, this product appears to be coming out of NYC which is rather interesting. Let us know your thoughts.
