Oil pens are great because they offer a lot of stealth and convenience. You're able to throw them in your bag or in your pocket because the cartridges don't leak (good ones), pull it out and it's immediately ready for use. This different from a wax pen where you have another container that holds your concentrate, and that you need to load into the pen at every use.

# Equipment (Incomplete)
An `oil pen` is most commonly composed of 2 parts, the cartridge and the battery (mod):

**Cartridge**: holds the juice and currently comes in two styles of atomizer: cotton wick or ceramic. 99% of the time, they use 510 threading and have the atomizers built in so you can't swap your atomizer out. Because of this people commonly call them `cartomizers`

Type|Pros|Cons
---|---|---
Cotton Wick|Cheap, easy to obtain|Affects taste, can dry burn
Silica Wick|-|-
Ceramic|Purer taste, usually more expensive|Prone to cracking if cheaply made


**Battery (mod)**: this is where the electricity comes from to power the cartomizer (cartridge with an atomizer built in). Usually they come in a few different types.


## Battery Types (Updated October 13, 2017)

There are a lot of batteries to power your cartomizers, here's a quick list of common types:

 - Automatic/Buttonless/Air-controlled
 - Simple Button
 - Button w/ Voltage Control
 - Box Mod

#### **Automatic/Buttonless/Air-controlled**

**Pros:**

 - Simple
 - Low-cost
 - Feels like toking from a joint
 - Easily accessible
 - Smallest size of all batteries

**Cons:**

 - All probably made by a handful of third-world manufacturers, don't be tricked by vendors marketing
 - Prone to failure (cheap materials)
 - Clogging due to air mechanism
 - Small battery, frequent recharges (50-200 puffs)
 - **May not work with all cartridges, even if the air hole is there to activate it, it may not support some cartridges do to the too high or too low of a resistance of the atomizer.**

**Information:**

- Lowest quality mod but it's something anyone can start with, you can get one for $2-$3USD
- Lowest barrier to entry as they feel similar to a joint
- A lot of vendors will slap their logo on and drop-ship from third world manufacturers for a marked up price but you can get one on eBay pretty cheap: [link](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338176501&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FVaporizer-Pen-Battery-Stylus-USB-Charger-510-Thread-Vape-O-Pen-Bud%2F252989581607%3F_trkparms%3Daid%253D222007%2526algo%253DSIM.MBE%2526ao%253D2%2526asc%253D45727%2526meid%253Dadd93348ba2e4f6ab7cc7e28c5144c6b%2526pid%253D100005%2526rk%253D6%2526rkt%253D6%2526sd%253D292149373123%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.c100005.m1851)


#### **Simple Button**

**Pros:**

 - Good for beginners
 - Low-cost
 - Simple
 - Easily accessible

**Cons:**

 - Annoying to hold button to heat
 - No control so your atomizer/cartridge resistance (ohms) will affect your draw
 - Small battery (200-400 puffs)
 - Quality varies a lot
 - Annoying controls (usually press 5 times to turn on or off
 - This is for safety)

**Information:**

- Like the automatic ones, these are simple beginner batteries
- The only advantage they have over the automatic ones are a slightly larger battery (but slightly larger size), and they don't have the air-flow clogging problems
- You can get them for around $4USD. Here's a quick search: [[link]](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338176501&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F1100mAh-eGo-T-Complete-Starter-Kit-e-Atomizer-e-Pen-USB-Charger-Vape-kit-Hot-HX%2F372027919680%3Fvar%3D640946433946%26_trkparms%3Daid%253D222007%2526algo%253DSIM.MBE%2526ao%253D1%2526asc%253D20140602152332%2526meid%253D5c9b6f3e6b77491888db5b0069310150%2526pid%253D100011%2526rk%253D6%2526rkt%253D12%2526sd%253D372031587610%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.c100011.m1850)
- At this point there are a lot of brands but you get what you pay for so just stick to reputable brands like Joyetech [[link]](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338176501&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F100-Original-Joyetech-eGo1500mah-Vape-E-pen-EG0-Aio-Starter-Kit-Hot-%2F112508043861%3Fvar%3D%26hash%3Ditem1a32008255%3Am%3AmMzhA7YVqfF7l8zT596nDCQ) or Smok. It's a bit more costly and to not have any type of control may not be worth it. Note that these two offer their AIO pens with eGo threading, not 510 threading which the majority of cartridges use

#### **Button w/ Voltage Control (Voltage dial or button press)**

**Pros:**

 - Low-cost
 - Simple
 - More selection on battery size
 - Can control temperature (but you usually just stick to a select temp/voltage per cartomizer brand)

**Cons:**

 - Annoying to turn on and off (5 presses)
 - Changing temperature feels clunky (fixed temp list batteries) (also have to press multiple times)
 - Voltage dial prone to wear and tear (voltage control batteries)
 - Price starts going up depending on vendor, some are worth the price and some are not
 - Prone to vendor marking up price
 - Quality varies quite a bit

**Information:**

 - There are two types of voltage control:
   - *Voltage dial* [(recommended bang-for-buck battery: Vision Spinner II [link])](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338176501&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FVision-2-II-Spinner-Battery-1650mAh-Variable-Voltage-510-Connection-Free-Charger%2F322659839945%3F_trkparms%3Daid%253D111001%2526algo%253DREC.SEED%2526ao%253D1%2526asc%253D20131017132637%2526meid%253D4995f73d636b425fa6b0308e1378ae41%2526pid%253D100033%2526rk%253D8%2526rkt%253D8%2526sd%253D263147625172%26_trksid%3Dp2045573.c100033.m2042): a dial at the bottom of the battery you can physically turn. This may get complicated for some as it's not easy to translate voltage into temperature.
   - *Fixed temperature*: press the button 3 times to cycle through one "temperature" level in a fixed list of temps. Usually these are a bit vague, they go by "low, med, high" or have a color code that cycles through different temperatures (it's just varying the voltage).


#### **Box Mod**

**Pros:**

 - Many choices for battery size
 - Precise control of temperature/voltage/wattage
 - Can build your own atomizer/coil and mix and match tanks
 - Usually larger tanks

**Cons:**

 - Not simple
 - Way too many choices
 - Expensive

**Information:**

 - I don't suggest anyone jumps into these without first knowing the oil pen scene, get one of the simpler ones first and then start shopping after you decide you like oil pens
 - Stick to the reputable brands like Joyetech, Smok, Eleaf

## E-Juice substances (completed Sept 9, 2017):

#### PEG - Polyethylene Glycol (Avoid)
  - Is toxic and used in antifreeze
  - Can be lethal at high doses
  - Ingestion can cause harm faster than inhalation
  - PEG was abandoned by a lot of e-juice manufacturers in favour of PG. PEG is lethal in high doses.
    - http://ejuiceconnoisseur.com/2013/10/21/the-final-word-on-propylene-glycol-vs-polyethylene-glycol/
    - https://www.e-cigarette-forum.com/forum/threads/purity-of-pg-vg-and-peg-the-short-version.277267/#post5540663

#### PG - Propylene Glycol (Recommended)
  - Used frequently in foods and medicines
  - Listed as `Generally Recognized as Safe` by the FDA
  - Approved for human consumption and inhalation by the FDA
  - Can be metabolised by the human body into naturally occurring chemicals
  - May cause dry throat, may be harsh during inhalation
  - May have some antibacterial/antiviral functionality

#### VG - Vegetable Glycerin (Recommended if diluted or you have a good tank)
  - Thicker than PG, not sure about PEG, so probably not good to dilute your concentrate with VG, your cartridge might clog or it might not heat properly
  - You may have to dilute a concentrate + VG mix with 20% distilled water
  - Produces sick clouds, go this option if you like clouds
  - Not known to cause allergic reactions as frequently as PG
  - Widely used in medicines for inhalation

**Remember: ALWAYS do your own research before putting any substance within your body**

# How to make oil from concentrates (Diluting/Mixing/Thinning) (completed Sept 9, 2017)

Since distillates are still kind of new, they are generally harder to obtain. It is also quite difficult to produce yourself unless you have your expensive equipment. Because of this, a lot of solutions have appeared to "dilute" or "thin" other concentrates, usually having to add another substance. This brings convenience, but there are also a lot of cons:

  - Dilutes potency
  - Can drastically change taste
  - May contain harmful chemicals
  - Subjective reviews online

Here are some brands that offer a thinning product:

Brand|Content|Description
---|---|---
EJmix|PG + PEG + Herbal Extract|May have chemical aftertaste. Worst reviewed "thinner" online. I'm not sure where to buy directly but there are a lot of vendors online, so google for one that ships to you or hit up ebay: [link] (https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338176501&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F50ML-EJMIX-ORIGINAL-Herbal-Liquidizer-EJ-MIX-Medical-Grade-PEG400-%2F112552106765%3Fhash%3Ditem1a34a0db0d%3Ag%3AoHsAAOSwTM5Y1S3p)
Wax Liquidizer|PG + PEG|Not a lot of negative comments, but it contains PEG (even though they try to hide it by saying the liquid contains "PG200/PG400" instead of "PEG200/PEG400"). You can hit up their site [link](https://www.waxliquidizer.com/shop/), google for a local reseller, or hit up ebay here: [link](https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&ipn=icep&toolid=20004&campid=5338176501&mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FWax-Liquidizer-Brand-New-Unopened-Original-Flavor-FREE-SHIPPING-%2F282373282916%3Fepid%3D771723288%26hash%3Ditem41bec25c64%3Ag%3AY8gAAOSwSlBYsLKj)
Vapeur Extract|PG USP + PEG USP + VG USP + Flavoring Extract|Apparently better than EJmix. Nice vapor clouds.
Holy Terp|Proprietary Organic Blend|Soapy/pine sol taste. Apparently better than vapeur extract. The "pure" line has a floral taste and does not contain PEG/VG/etc.
Connoisseur "The Solution"|Naturally Derived Terpenes or Artificial Flavors + PG or Natural Derived Flavors| Expensive, but you do not have to use a lot.
Puff Majic|PG USP + PEG USP + Natural Organic Compound/Artificial Flavor|People loved it more than EJmix, but it still has a plastic taste
