## Commonly used extracts

Basically all types, although some substances need extra work.

Type|Description|%THC|Texture/Viscosity|Dilute?|What to do
:---|---|---|---|---|---
Distillate|Purest form of concentrate, but a lot of the terpenes and other cannabinoids removed|`>85%`|Runny, think honey that's slightly below room temperature, seems to be less runny than CO2/BHO oil|No (depends)|May be able to put directly into cartridge, but consider diluting. Viscosity will vary across brands.
CO2/BHO Oil||`50%-90%`|Runny like honey|No|Place directly into cartridge, no additional work required, although some like to dilute a bit.
Wax||`>60%`|Think slightly hardened honey, or taffy|Yes|Get dilutant
Budder||`>50%`|Like peanut butter|Yes|Get dilutant, may require more diluting or winterization than other concentrates
Crumble||`??`|Like bread cumbs, or apple crumble|Don't|It won't be able to dissolve properly
Shatter||`>60%`|Hard candy. Think jolly rancher.|Yes|Get dilutant
Herb|You should know what this is|`<27%`|Organic plant matter|Don't even think about it|You're better off getting a herb vape
