AbsoluteXtracts is committed to offering patients safe, pure and powerful cannabis concentrates. Sourcing their flower from sun-grown farms in California’s Emerald Triangle, AbsoluteXtracts crafts high-THC, CO2 extracted medical marijuana products ranging from vape pens to honey sticks. They dedicate their work to providing consistent, lasting relief to patients in need, all while keeping their cannabis excellent and their prices as affordable as possible.

Process:

AbsoluteXtracts begins with healthy and hearty cannabis plants, taken from the best genetic fingerprints and completely tested for pathogens, viruses, or other shortcomings. These saplings are grown in AbsoluteXtracts high-quality greenhouses, as well as on family farms sprinkled across Northern California. These marijuana buds are harvested and transported to AbsoluteXtracts Santa Rosa facility for processing.

Once all plant materials are tested for mold and pesticides, they are cured, dried and sent to their pharmaceutical-grade processing room. AbsoluteXtracts uses high-pressure CO2 to extract the cannabinoids from the marijuana plant. Their proprietary methods retain the cannabis’ terpenes, which are reintroduced to offer each strain its distinct flavor and smell. Packaged and designed for easy use, AbsoluteXtracts zero-additive concentrates are then ready to satisfy cannabis connoisseurs across California.

Products:

AbsoluteXtracts caters to the full spectrum of cannabis connoisseurs, offering product ranging from premium flower to sublingual sprays and everything in between. Their strain-specific cannabis vape cartridges contain 500mg of refined cannabis oil, infused with cannabis-sourced terpenes to provide both the flavors and effects of desired strains. AbsoluteXtracts soft gels are mixed with MCT oil to aid in the absorption, and their Cannabis Applicators offer a pre-measured application of cannabis oil for cooking and topical use. Sublingual sprays and honey straws provide fast-acting or slow-response relief, and AbsoluteXtracts’ strains of traditional cannabis flower are all free of toxins or pesticides.

Lab Testing:

AbsoluteXtracts tests their cannabis products at each stage of production, from source genetics to flower to be processed to final concentrate form. All the goods are tested for pesticides, microbes, residual solvents, mold, and other toxins.
