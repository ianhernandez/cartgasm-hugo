Lemon Tree originated decades ago as a unique cross of Lemon Skunk and Sour Diesel whose caretakers worked to preserve its terpene profile, potency, and delicious flavor. After years of growing and tending the bud, Lemon Tree’s founders would deliver their precious strain to local dispensaries and patients, who all adored the euphoria Lemon Tree provided. As regulations in California changed, they decided they wanted to put a name to the herb, and in 2014, Lemon Tree officially began, offering their unique genetics in flower, concentrate, and vape cartridge form. Since their launch, they’ve expanded throughout northern California and are slowly reaching down to offer Lemon Tree to the cannabis connoisseur community.
