Bloom Farms is built upon the belief that cannabis can enhance a healthy, fulfilling lifestyle. We aim to remove negative stigmas by inviting patients to take a fresh look at time-tested and lab-tested medicine.

For an ethereal experience, choose Bloom Farms. Bloom Farms crafts cannabis vapor pens, prerolls, and extractions to perfection. At the core of Bloom Farms is the belief that marijuana is a holistic tool given by nature to enhance a lifestyle of wellness and fulfillment.

Our mission is to bring safe and enjoyable medicine to patients who use medical cannabis as part of a healthy, fulfilling lifestyle. Along the way, we’re out to remove the negative social stigmas of cannabis. Sustainably farmed and responsibly made, our products are beautifully designed around our mantra: relaxation, relief, creativity and fun. At Bloom Farms, we believe in living life to its fullest. We’re here to bring a healthy perspective to life with cannabis.

We work with responsible California family farmers to grow our cannabis. We extract our oil with clean CO2; the same process used in extracting essential oils, without petroleum-based solvents. We meticulously lab- test for purity.

Social responsibility is fundamental to our mission. We pledge that with every purchase, Bloom Farms will provide a meal to someone in need! We are a one-for-one company and our goal is to provide 1,000,000 meals to food-insecure households.
