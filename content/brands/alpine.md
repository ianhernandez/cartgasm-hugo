## Our Mission

The Alpine Vapor mission is to produce the purest, safest and most discreet cannabis products on the market. We pair cutting-edge distillation technology with beautiful and accessible design to serve the full spectrum of cannabis enthusiasts, from first-time patients to experienced connoisseurs. We want to raise the bar for cannabis-infused goods and provide the world with An Elevated Experience™.

### Our Method

Pure oil starts with pure ingredients, which is why we exclusively use organic sun-grown cannabis from Humboldt County, right in the heart of California cannabis country. These plants are tested regularly to ensure that they’re free from pesticides, microbial and other harmful contaminants.

We then run these flowers through a supercritical CO2 fluid extraction (SCFE) system that yields cannabinoid-rich oil without the residual plant matter or solvents often found in other extracts. This is the same process used to produce decaffeinated coffee and aromatherapy oils, and it is one of the cleanest and safest methods for extracting cannabis available.

To achieve the ultimate potency and consistency, we refine our oil even further using state-of-the-art molecular distillation technology. The result is a cannabis oil of unrivaled purity and clarity, which serves as the foundation of our entire collection of premium cannabis products.

### Quality & Safety

All Alpine products are held to the highest quality control and testing standards to ensure that we deliver a clean and consistent experience every time. We test every batch using advanced high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), which allows us to fine tune the balance of cannabinoids and terpenes in our products with the utmost precision. For extra safety, we also submit every batch to SC Labs to verify that our products are 100% free of solvents, pesticides, and other impurities.
