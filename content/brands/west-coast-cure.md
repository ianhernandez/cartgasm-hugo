Our Mission:

There’s no question; West Coast Cure is the first name in high-end wax products.



West Coast Cure brings years of connoisseur cannabis mastery to the table, effortlessly offering consumers the best in wax and other medical marijuana experience. With an award-winning pedigree and that extra something special, West Coast Cure is the go-to cannabis label for celebrities and connoisseurs alike. It’s not something West Coast Cure works at; they’re simply the best at what they do.

History:

West Coast Cure began in the same way many great companies do: a passion for a product that grew into something more. In Newport Beach back in 2010, the founding team could not find a satisfactory wax product on the market that met their high standards of quality. Dissatisfied, they invested their time, resources, and expert cannabis knowledge to create the high-end wax for themselves and others with the same expectation of excellence. In their five years since embarking on their mission as one of the first extract companies around, West Coast Cure has become a household name in the wax industry. They’ve now grown into an iconic Marijuana Brand, expanding into vapes and pre-rolled joints to highlight their product in other fashions. When they see West Coast Cure’s crown logo, consumers know they’re laying eyes on the best in the business.

Products:

Each product created by West Coast Cure is crafted with excellence cultivated after years of experience in the concentrate field. “Extracts” is West Coast Cure’s middle name, and they proudly offer a selection of high-end concentrates, shatters, budder, vape shatter cartridges and much more. Their products are often featured in celebrity media, and their Hardcore Shatter delivers an instantaneous and passionate high with a single dab. Whether from their award-winning Bhombline or more adventurous Red and Black Labels, West Coast Cure is the first (and only) choice in concentrates.

Lab Testing:

Consistent with their enduring commitment to quality, West Coast Cure sends all their products to SC Labs for comprehensive testing, including cannabinoid profile, terpene profile, pesticides, microbes and more. Lovers of West Coast Cure rest assured that they’re dabbing the purest concentrates on the market.
