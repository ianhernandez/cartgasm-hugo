The 710 KingPen is LoudPack Extracts personal marijuana / THC vaporizer, or “Vape Pen”. This device has gained popularity in recent years, as tobacco products take on a similar look-and-feel with their version of the vape pen called, E-Cigs, and the stigma associated with marijuana use, continues to go up in smoke. Vaping has gained such widespread acceptance worldwide, that the word “vape” was recently added to the Oxford English Dictionary, as well as being named their 2014 Word of the Year. When it comes to the world of vaping there is only one top dog. The 710 KingPen was presented with the top award and honors, in the vape products category’s, at the High Times Cannabis Cup, in both Los Angeles, California, and Denver, Colorado. The 710 KingPen is the next-generation, hand-held portable vaporizer, designed to heat the product to a temperature a drop below the combustion level, so that it produces a vapor which is inhaled, instead of a smoke. Many medical marijuana patients who are unable to smoke rely on this form of medicating. It is a well-known medical fact that the carcinogens associated with smoking are far more dangerous than the method of vaporization. And because the 710 KingPen provides a discrete way to use medical cannabis in public, they are naturally in high-demand, in the recreational markets too.
