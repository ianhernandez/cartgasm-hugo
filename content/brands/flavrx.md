Our Mission:

Consistency. Purity. Reliability.



FlavRx is dedicated to the advancement of the field of cannabis science. With their many amazing products, including vape cartridges, concentrates, edibles, vaporizing pens, and more, FlavRx harnesses the natural healing powers of cannabis with the cutting edge technology developed in their laboratory. FlavRx revolutionizes bringing clean, pure medicine to patients looking for a simple and effective way to medicate.

History:

FlavRx got their start as many great ideas get their start - out of genuine desire to improve patientsâ€™ quality of life with the healing power of medical cannabis. Noticing the lack of quality products in the marijuana industry, FlavRx saw an opportunity to better the community by reinventing the way cannabis users consume their medicine.

After extensive research in the newest cutting-edge methods of marijuana extraction and infusion, FlavRx developed products specifically designed to take advantage of the most of the marijuana plant.

Process:

FlavRx is at the forefront of scientific cannabis extraction and infusion. Taking purified raw cannabinoids extracted from their proprietary solventless method, they then infuse with unique terpene blends. Their extraction technique ensures a highly pure cannabis concentrate with no residual waxes or fats. Their terpene blends are made specifically to strain type to provide the natural flavors and tastes from their original Sativa, Indica, and Hybrid strains.

Products:

FlavRx concentrates represents cutting edge scientific knowledge and the cannabis community in every single package. Along with their signature premium CO2 cartridges in Sativa, Indica, and Hybrid strains, FlavRx has a wide variety of products including disposable joints, vape batteries, clear concentrates, cannabis-infused chocolates, and apparel.
