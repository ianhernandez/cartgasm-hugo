Honey Vape provides California Patients with the highest grade medicinal cannabis oil in the state. Our mission is to create the perfect blend of science and nature to keep our oils as close to the living plant as possible. We achieve this through our painstaiking cleaning and terpene profiling process, that produces the most robust, botanically identical, genetic strains so patients can enjoy their favorite strains in an oil form. Our system maintains the integrity of the flower by giving the patient back the original flavor, scent, and most importantly effect, of the the plant before it was even harvested. In doing so, patients can enjoy the full medicinal expression that nature had intended.
