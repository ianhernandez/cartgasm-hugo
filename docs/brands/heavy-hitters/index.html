          <div style="font-size:18px;"><p>Our Mission:</p>

<p>A trailblazer’s companion.</p>

<p>Heavy Hitters, also known as “A Trailblazer&rsquo;s Companion,” offers some of the most potent, high-end concentrates and vape cartridges on the market. Proudly lining the shelves of dispensaries across Southern California, Heavy Hitters’ cutting-edge cannabis line pushes the boundaries of the marijuana industry, continually inventing and innovating new processes to provide consumers alternatives to traditional smoking. They proudly stand as one of the first high-potency concentrate cartridges in Los Angeles, and true to their name, Heavy Hitters’ waxes and cartridges pack a potent punch that delivers all the wonders of a high-quality cannabis experience.</p>

<p>Products:</p>

<p>A patient favorite, Heavy Hitters’ Vape Concentrates are available in many flavors. Everything from Skywalker OG to 710 Connoisseur, with noticeable and delicious favors. The cartridges last for quite a long time with packaging that instantly identifies Heavy Hitters’ quality. Their CO2 Distillate is among the highest potency THC products on the market, utterly free of contaminants and made with award-winning standards.</p>

<p>Lab Testing:</p>

<p>Heavy Hitters submits all of their cannabis products for lab testing, working with SC Labs, Steep Hills, and CW Analytical to ensure their concentrates are nothing but top-quality. Their submissions test for terpenes, potency, cannabinoids, and residual solvents and materials.</p>

<p>Networks:</p>

<p>Currently, Heavy Hitters lines the shelves of dispensaries across Los Angeles, Orange County, the Inland Empire, San Diego and the Central California Coast. In the next year, they plan on expanding to Northern California, including the Bay Area and Sacramento and making their high-quality concentrates available to patients and recreational users across the state.</p>
